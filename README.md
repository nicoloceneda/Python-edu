# Python Education

On my [website](www.nicoloceneda.com) (www.nicoloceneda.com) there is a *Python* section, which contains the Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib sub-sections. These are intended to provide an introductory knowledge to these powerful libraries. This repository contains the Jupyer Notebook files of the Python documentation available on the website.
