However, sometimes, repeating an operation is not the best option: for example, if we have a list that we would like to sort, we might be misled by a repeated operation, as sorting a pre-sorted list is much faster than sorting an unsorted list, so the repetition will skew the result.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"sydGJsl394dP","colab_type":"text"},"source":["**Time the execution of a single line statement without repetition** using the IPython magic function **`%time`**\n","\n","```python\n","# Sorting an unsorted list\n","\n","In [3]: import random\n","\n","In [4]: L = [random.random() for i in range(100000)]\n","\n","In [5]: %time L.sort()\n","CPU times: user 18.6 ms, sys: 70 µs, total: 18.7 ms\n","Wall time: 18.6 ms\n","\n","# Sorting an sorted list\n","\n","In [6]: %time L.sort()\n","CPU times: user 1.52 ms, sys: 8 µs, total: 1.53 ms\n","Wall time: 1.53 ms\n","```\n","\n","Notice how much faster the presorted list is to sort and also how much longer the timing takes with `%time` versus `%timeit`, even for the presorted list.
