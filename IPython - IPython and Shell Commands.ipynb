But operating systems existed long before these graphical user interfaces, and were primarily controlled through sequences of text input: at the prompt, the user would type a command, and the computer would do what the user told it to. Those early prompt systems are the presecutors of the shells and terminals that most active data scientists still use today. \n","\n","If you are unfamiliar with the shell commands, I would suggest to review the [Shell Tutorial](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) put together by the Software Carpentry Foundation.\n","\n","When working interactively with the standard Python interpreter, one of the frustrations you will face is the need to switch between multiple windows to access Python tools and system command-line tools. IPython bridges this gap, and gives you a sintax for executing shell commands directly within the IPython terminal."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"2oPv1Io9Y0Cy","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Shell Commands In Python\n","\n","**Access a shell command in a IPython session**  using the IPython prefix character **`!`**\n","\n","```python\n","In [1]: !pwd\n","/Users/nicolo/Desktop\n","\n","In [2]: !echo \"Hello World\"\n","Hello World\n","```\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"pKbcAMB6aaDY","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Passing Values to and from the Shell\n","\n","Shell commands can not only be called from IPython, but can also be made to interact with the IPython namespace.\n","\n","**Save the output of a shell command to a Python list** using the assignment operator **`=`**\n","\n","```python\n","In [3]: directory = !pwd\n","\n","In [4]: print(directory)\n","['/Users/nicolo/Desktop']\n","```\n","\n","Note that these results are not returned as lists, but as a special shell return type defined in IPython:\n","\n","```python\n","In [5]: type(directory)\n","Out[5]: IPython.utils.text.SList\n","```\n","\n","This looks and acts a lot like a Python list, but has additional functionality.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"7vUjvwzrdNV4","colab_type":"text"},"source":["**Pass a Python variable to the shell** using the syntax **`{varname}`**\n","\n","```python\n","In [6]: message = \"Hello World\"\n","\n","In [7]: !echo {message}\n","Hello World\n","```\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"m2Gf3RYgeCrA","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Shell Related Magic Commands\n","\n","IPython does not allow to use the !cd command to navigate the filesystem: this is because shell commands are executed in a temporary sub-shell.\n","\n","```python\n","In [8]: !pwd\n","/Users/nicolo/Desktop\n","\n","In [9]: !ls\n","Myfolder\n","\n","In [10]: !cd Myfolder\n","\n","In [11]: !pwd\n","/Users/nicolo/Desktop\n","```\n","\n","**Change the working directory in a IPython session** using the IPython magic function **`%cd`**\n","\n","```python\n","In [12]: !pwd\n","/Users/nicolo/Desktop\n","\n","In [13]: %cd Myfolder\n","/Users/nicolo/Desktop/Myfolder\n","\n","In [14]: !pwd\n","/Users/nicolo/Desktop/Myfolder\n","```\n","\n","By default you can use the magic command even without the `%` sign: this is known as an automagic function.\n","\n","Other shell-like magic functions are `%cat`, `%cp`, `%env`, `%ls`, `%man`, `%mkdir`, `%more`, `%mv`, `%pwd`, `%rm`, `%rmdir`, any of which can be used without the `%` if automagic is on.  \n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"CuRCvSelj0_U","colab_type":"text"},"source":["---\n","\n","Back >> [Input and Output History.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ixIGp58g3XD-0s4eaSYaQcZphKOR2whZ?usp=sharing)\n","\n","Next >> [Errors and Debugging.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Fs5UnoLBEOtSmQ0lgo-L0O4uKHSbut1_?usp=sharing)\n"]}]}
