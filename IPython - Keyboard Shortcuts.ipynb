These shortcuts are not in fact provided by IPython itself, but through its dependency on the GNU Readline library: thus, some of the following shortcuts may differ depending on the system configuation. Also, while some of these shortcuts do work in the browser-based notebook, this section is primarily about shortcuts in the IPython shell.
