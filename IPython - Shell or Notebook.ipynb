Though the IPython notebook is viewed and edited through your web browser window, it must connect to a running Python process in order to execute code. To start this process (known as kernel), type **`jupyter notebook`** in the terminal. This command will launch a local web server that will be visible to your browser. It immediately spits out a log showing what it is doing; that log will look something like this:\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","```\n","[I 01:56:24.672 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /Users/nicolo\n","[I 01:56:24.672 NotebookApp] Jupyter Notebook 6.1.3 is running at:\n","[I 01:56:24.672 NotebookApp] http://localhost:8888/...\n","[I 01:56:24.672 NotebookApp]  or http://127.0.0.1:8888/...\n","[I 01:56:24.672 NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).\n","[C 01:56:24.677 NotebookApp] \n","    \n","    To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:\n","        file:///Users/nicolo/Library/Jupyter/runtime/nbserver-13423-open.html\n","    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:\n","        http://localhost:8888/...\n","     or http://127.0.0.1:8888/...\n","```\n","\n","Upon issuing the command, your default browser should automatically open and navigate to the listed local URL; the exact address will depend on your system.
